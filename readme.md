**Introduction**
Welcome to the wide world of SQL. I hope you're ready to be confused.

**What is SQL?**
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a type of computer language which we primarily use to "extract" data from our databases.

There are different "types" of databases. All use SQL but have slight differences which you may or may not work out along the way. To help guide you with terms you will hear, we have:

Oracle - this is generally a physical server somewhere locally
Postgres - this is used more by the systems "in the cloud"
